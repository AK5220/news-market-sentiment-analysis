Exam project: News and Market Sentiment Analytics

The project analyses whether sentiment extracted from financial news headlines can predict next-day market direction for the S&P 500. Two dictionary-based sentiment approaches are implemented: an AFINN-based sentiment measure and a simple bag-of-words method. These are evaluated against a non-textual baseline based on past market direction.
